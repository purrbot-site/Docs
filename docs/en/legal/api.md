## Privacy Policy

### 1. General Information
The Purrbot API ("API") does not collect or store any personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive data beyond what is typically transmitted as part of a standard HTTP GET or POST request.

### 2. Data Handling
Certain endpoints, such as the `/owoify` endpoint, require user-provided input (e.g. text content) either through a JSON body in a POST request or as a query parameter in a GET request. This input is **only processed in-memory** for the purpose of generating a response. It is **not stored**, logged, or retained in any way.

### 3. Data Storage
The API does not store request payloads, including text sent to endpoints like `/owoify`. No database or persistent storage is used to retain user-submitted data.

### 4. Third-Party Services
The API does not use any third-party analytics, tracking or external services that collect data from users.

### 5. Security
While the API itself does not store user data, it follows standard web security practices to help ensure safe usage. Users are still responsible for ensuring that any data sent to the API does not violate any applicable laws or platform rules.

### 6. Updates to This Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated occasionally. Changes will be announced alongside updates to the Terms of Service, and users will have the option to discontinue use if they do not agree with the changes.
