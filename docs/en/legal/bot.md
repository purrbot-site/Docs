## Terms of Service

### 1. Agreement to Terms
By inviting the Discord bot `*Purr*#6875` (Discord bot ID: `425382319449309197`, hereafter referred to as the "Bot") to a server or using any of its features, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"), the accompanying [Privacy Policy](#privacy-policy), as well as the [API Terms of Service and Privacy Policy](api.md) when using features powered by the Bot's external API.

You are permitted to invite the Bot to any server where you have the appropriate permissions. Continued usage of the Bot and its features implies agreement to these Terms, the [Discord Terms of Service][discord-tos], [Discord Privacy Policy][discord-policy], and Discord's [Community Guidelines][discord-guidelines].

Violation of any of these Terms or policies may result in the Bot being removed from your server without notice.

### 2. Data Collection and Use
By inviting or using the Bot, you agree to the collection and use of data as outlined in the [Privacy Policy](#privacy-policy). The Bot uses this data strictly to deliver its intended functionality.

Additionally, some features rely on an external API which has its own [API Terms of Service and Privacy Policy](api.md). Continued use of these features constitues acceptance of those documents as well.

### 3. Age Restrictions
Use of the Bot is permitted only for individuals who meet Discord's minimum age requirements as outlined in their [Terms of Service][discord-tos].  
Some features are restricted to "age-gated" (NSFW) channels and may only be accessed by users of legal age in their respective jurisdiction. Missuse of these features, especially by or for underage users, will result in immediate removal of the Bot from all related servers.

### 4. Affiliations
The Bot is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or created by Discord Inc.  
All references to Discord and its associated trademarks are used only for descriptive purposes. The developers of \*Purr\* make no claims to ownership of Discord's assets, trademarks, or intellectual property.

### 5. Limitation of Liability
The developers of the Bot expect it to be used in good faith and for its intended purpose. The Bot should not be used in any way that violates Discord's policies or causes harm to other users, communities, or services.

We reserve the right to update these Terms or the [Privacy Policy](#privacy-policy) at any time. Updates will be announced with a seven (7) notice period. You may opt out by removing the Bot fom your server and ceasing its use.

### 6. Contact
For questions or support should the following forms of contacts be used:

- **Email:** `support[at]purrbot.site`

## Privacy Policy

### 1. Data Usage
The Bot collects limited server-specific data to enable and enhance features such as welcome messages and command handling.  
This data is not shared with third-parties and is used solely for Bot functionality. However, select features rely on an external API governed by its own [API Privacy Policy](api.md).

### 2. Data Stored
Upon being added to a server, the following default data may be stored by the Bot:

- `id`: Server ID
- `language`: Default value `en`
- `prefix`: Default command prefix `p.`
- `welcome_background`: Default `color_white`
- `welcome_channel`: Default `none`
- `welcome_color`: Default `#000000`
- `welcome_icon`: Default `purr`
- `welcome_message`: Default `Welcome {mention}!`

No additional data is stored without explicit user interaction.

### 3. Data Updates
Certain features may allow users to update this data. These updates may include user-provided content (e.g. custom welcome messages), which may be considered identifiable or sensitive. This data is stored securely and used only for its stated purpose.

### 4. Temporary Caching
To improve performance, some data may be cached temporarely.  
Cached data is automatically cleared after a predetermined duration or may be invalidated early, such as when the Bot is removed from the server.

### 5. Third-Party API Use
Some Bot features require interaction with an external API. When these features are used, your data may be transmitted to and processed by the API according to its own [API Terms of Service and Privacy Policy](api.md). We encourage users to review those documents before using such features.

### 6. Data Deletion

#### Automatic Deletion
Removing the Bot from a server triggers automatic deletion of all related stored data. Reinviting the Bot will result in new data being collected per the [Data Stored](#2-data-stored) section.

#### Manual Deletion
You may request manual deletion of your server's data by emailing `support[at]purrbot.site`.  
For security reasons, requests must come from the server owner, and proof of ownership may be required.  
Manual data removal will result in the Bot being removed from the server, if still present.
