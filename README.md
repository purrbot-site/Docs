# Docs
![badge]

This is the source of the [PurrBot Documentation][docs] containing the [Wiki of \*Purr*][wiki] and [ImageAPI documentation][api-docs].  
The content is made in Markdown, build using [MkDocs][mkdocs] with the [Material for MkDocs theme][mkdocs-material] and hosted using [GitHub Pages][gh-pages].

## Contributions
Please take a look at our [CONTRIBUTING.md][contribute] file and also the [formatting help][formatting] on our documentation.

## Build Previews
We use a [custom Workflow][workflow] to create previews of Pull requests.  
The setup is inspired by the one used by [blueedgetechno] for [win11React][win11react] ([Workflow File][win11react-action])
